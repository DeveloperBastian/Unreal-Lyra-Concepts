# Unreal-Lyra-Concepts
Concepts on my journey to use Lyra as a basis for games.
An [Infographics](https://github.com/DeveloperBastian/Unreal-Lyra-Concepts/blob/main/infographics/Unreal%20Lyra.pdf) will summarize all steps.

I will publish in parallel videos to explain all concepts at https://www.youtube.com/@bastiandev
